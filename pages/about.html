        <p>As a help desk technician, I have developed a keen interest in the fields of software engineering, application security, and bug hunting. I aspire to transition into these roles, which involve designing and building software applications, ensuring their security, and searching for vulnerabilities and bugs. To achieve this goal, I plan to continue my education and training to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge, such as programming languages and development methodologies, security best practices, and bug-hunting techniques. I am excited to embark on this journey towards becoming a software engineer, application security engineer, and bug bounty hunter, and I am committed to working hard to achieve my goals in these fields.</p>
